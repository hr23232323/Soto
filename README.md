*Soto is a one-stop solution for living your best life through purposefully scheduling where you put in your time. It allows users with different preferences to experience scheduling the way they want to on the fly, incorporating common scheduling tools like todo lists and calendars beautifully into one location.*

## User Experience Design
We designed Soto with the user in mind. We wanted to provide users with the ability to experience todo lists in different formats, while maintaining a simple and pleasant to user experience. In order to acheieve this, we utilized a simple UI design which can be seen below:

Further, we utilized angular conditional formatting to show inplace editing to maintain the minimal look which can be seen below:

Moreover, we also implemented a calendar view into our app which queries all todos based on the due date and shows the user what their week will look like:

All of our design choices were made keeping the user and their preferences in mind to give a pleasant, while still useful design implementation.
